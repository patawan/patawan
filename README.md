### Hello There! (General Kenobi) ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Engineer with many years of experience in the financial services industry, and several years in IT, plus a masterâ€™s degree in Data Analytics. I have built expertise within AWS, holding multiple certifications, and creating robust software stacks with infrastructure as code. In my free time I use my own personal "home lab" to learn about new technologies and practice new tech skills in a fun and low-pressure environment.
